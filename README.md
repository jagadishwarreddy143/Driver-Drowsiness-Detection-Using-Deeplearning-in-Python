# Driver Drowsiness Detection

This project implements a driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision techniques. The system monitors the driver's eyes and triggers an alarm when signs of drowsiness are detected.

## Overview

The application captures real-time video from a webcam and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze the state of the driver's eyes. If both eyes are detected to be closed for an extended period, the system considers the driver to be drowsy and triggers an alarm.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Video Capture**: Uses OpenCV to capture video from the webcam.
- **Eye Detection**: Uses Haar Cascade classifiers to detect the driver's eyes.
- **Drowsiness Detection**: Classifies the state of the eyes (open/closed) using a pre-trained CNN model.
- **Alarm Trigger**: Plays an alarm sound if drowsiness is detected.
- **User Interface**: A simple GUI built using Tkinter to start and stop the detection process.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jagadishwarreddy143/Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Using-Deeplearning-in-Python
   cd driver-drowsiness-detection
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset for the CNN model from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/serenaraju/yawn-eye-dataset-new)【6:2†source】.

4. Ensure that the following files are available in the correct directories:
   - Haar Cascade XML files for face and eye detection.
   - The pre-trained CNN model file (`cnncat2.h5`).

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python ex.py
   ```

2. A window will appear with options to start and stop the drowsiness detection.

3. The system will monitor the driver's eyes, and if drowsiness is detected, an alarm will sound.

## File Structure

- `ex.py`: Main Python script for the drowsiness detection application.
- `alarm.wav`: The sound file played when drowsiness is detected.
- `Dataset.txt`: Contains the link to download the dataset used for training the CNN model【6†source】.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Keras
- Pygame
- Tkinter
- PIL (Pillow)
